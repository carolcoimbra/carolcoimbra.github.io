	abstract = {Migration has been proposed as one of the factors that shape cultural similarities across countries. However, studying the relationship between culture and migration has been challenging, in part because culture is difficult to quantify. The traditionally used survey questionnaires have a number of drawbacks, including that they are costly and difficult to scale to a large number of countries. To complement survey data, we propose the use of passively-collected digital traces from social media. We focus on food and drink as markers of a country’s culture. We then measure similarities between countries in terms of food and drink interests using aggregated data from the Facebook Advertising Platform. Methodologically, we offer approaches to measure the similarity between countries with both symmetric and asymmetric indices. Substantively, we assess the association between migration cultural similarity between countries by comparing our measure of cultural similarity with international migration data. In most countries, larger immigrant populations are associated with more similar food and drink preferences between their country of origin and the country of destination. Our results suggest that immigrants contribute to bringing the culture of their home countries to new countries. Moreover, our study identifies considerable variability in this pattern across countries.},

            We consider the availability of new harmonized data sources and novel machine learning methodologies in the construction of a social vulnerability index (SoVI), a multidimensional measure that defines how individuals’ and communities may respond to hazards including natural disasters, economic changes, and global health crises. The factors underpinning social vulnerability—namely, economic status, age, disability, language, ethnicity, and location—are well understood from a theoretical perspective, and existing indices are generally constructed based on specific data chosen to represent these factors. Further, the indices’ construction methods generally assume structured, linear relationships among input variables and may not capture subtle nonlinear patterns more reflective of the multidimensionality of social vulnerability. We compare a procedure which considers an increased number of variables to describe the SoVI factors with existing approaches that choose specific variables based on consensus within the social science community. Reproducing the analysis across eight countries, as well as leveraging deep learning methods which in recent years have been found to be powerful for finding structure in data, demonstrate that wealth-related factors consistently explain the largest variance and are the most common element in social vulnerability.},

            One of the strongest empirical regularities in spatial demography is that flows of migrants are positively associated with population stocks at origin and destination and are inversely related to distance. This pattern was formalized into what are known as gravity models of migration. Traditionally, distance is measured geographically, but other measures of distance, such as cultural distance, are also relevant in explaining migration flows. However, measures of cultural distance are not widely adopted in the literature on modeling migration flows, partially because of the difficulties associated with operationalizing and producing these measures across space and time. In this paper, we use a scalable approach to obtain proxies for measuring cultural similarity between countries by using Facebook data and illustrate the impact of incorporating these measures, based on food and drink interests, into gravity models for predicting migration. Our results show that, despite their limitations, the new measures of cultural similarity derived from Facebook data improve the prediction power of traditional gravity models and have a predictive capacity comparable to that of classic variables used in the literature, such as shared language and history. The results open up new opportunities for understanding the determinants of migration and for predicting migration when considering broader and complementary perspectives on the meaning and measurement of distance.},
